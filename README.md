# Finance Kart: The Prisha Quest

This repository now ships a browser-based mini game that turns Prisha's achievements into a finance-themed kart racer.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/cv-the-game.git
   cd cv-the-game
   ```

2. Launch the game by opening `index.html` in your favourite browser (double-click it or serve the folder with any static server).

3. Press **Start Race**, steer with the **← / →** or **A / D** keys, collect growth investments, and avoid risk events to unlock each level of Prisha's journey.

> Tip: Use a local static server (such as `npx serve .`) if your browser blocks local scripts.
